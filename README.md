# Module 2 Challenge - Stock-Analysis Using Excel VBA


## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to help our client analyze the performance of stocks in 2017 and 2018. The stocks were analyzed based on total daily volume and percentage returns over the year. 
- **Total Daily Volume** is equal to the sum of daily volume for a given ticker and year. 
- **Return** was calculated by dividing the ending stock price for a given ticker and year by its starting price; value is displayed as a percentage.

In addition to calculating the total daily volume and return of the various stocks, this workbook was created to be user-friendly and avoid manual calculations. VBA code was used to automate the calculations of each value. It also was developed to allow the user to reset the analysiz with the click of a button, as well as calculator either years' values at the click of a button. 

Finally, the original code was refactored to allow the analysis to run in a shorter period of time. This provides a better user experience by shortening the time of the analysis, as well as allows the workbook to handle large volume of data.
